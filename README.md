# [RS Lang](https://shaqi-dev.github.io/rs-lang-client/)

## Stack
- `React` - has helped us efficiently update and render only the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make our code more predictable and easier to debug.
- `TypeScript` - adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with our code editors. Static typing helped us avoid a lot of bugs at the development stage, as well as improve code readability.
- `Redux Toolkit` - helped us in creating the global state of the application, as well as making highly efficient asynchronous requests to the server api.
- `ESLint` + `Prettier` - these libraries are responsible for maintaining the same code style and speed up the code refactoring process.
- `React Router Dom` - used to create routing between pages and redirects.
- `React Hook Form` - provides efficient state management as well as validation of signup and signin forms.
- `React Paginate` - lightweight library to make it easy to create pagination between textbook pages.
- `Recharts` - very powerful and flexible library for creating all kinds of charts.
- `React-Bootstrap` - powerful style and components library, in our project used to get some ready-made styles.
